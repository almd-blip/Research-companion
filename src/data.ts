Standard tools operate as static storage cabinets or mechanical formatters. Few systems support the highly non-linear, emotionally demanding, and cognitively exhausting lifecycles of complex creative and research projects.

Our vision is a digital workspace that actively nurtures intellectual agency. Rather than stressing creators and researchers with productivity metrics, daily writing streaks, and constant notification loops, the Research Companion provides a quiet, offline-first library atmosphere. It respects the cognitive flow state, ensures absolute data privacy, maintains traceable evidence lines, and integrates advanced generative AI as a humble dialogue partner rather than an authoritative writer. The platform acts as an intellectual anchor, sustaining creators, researchers, and writers through the journeys of project reports, articles, books, dissertations, and complex funding applications while keeping integrity pristine.`

• Offline Local Sync Engine: Intercepts client-side writes, saving drafts, annotations, and metadata into localStorage or local indexedDB. It provides JSON import/export (Research Companion Archive) for zero-cloud reliance.
• Application Server Layer (Express + Node.js): Serves as a local API gateway in dev mode or container node. Proxies AI requests to Gemini API, keeping credentials securely hidden from the browser.

• Wellbeing Sentry: A quiet footer that houses the calm audio player and Pomodoro timer, accessible via hotkeys, displaying no flashing tickers or anxiety-inducing timers.
